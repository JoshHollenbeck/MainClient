# MainClient
Main Client is banking application for employees in a banking institution. It allows the user to view and edit client information, create transactions for clients, and more.

# Initial Setup
Take the sql table from the Database folder and run them in order. Start with BankDB and work your way down. For LU_words.Table_1, 2, and 3. Run them in that exact order. Once the database is completely set up, open the SQLConnection.cs file in the utilities folder and set "connectionString" to the location of your database. That should set it so you can utilize the database.
