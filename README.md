Take the sql table from the Database folder and run them in order. Start with 01_DatabaseAndTables and work your way down. For AcctTransactions_01, 02, 03 and LU_words_01, 02, and 03. Run them in that exact order. Once the database is completely set up, open the SQLConnection.cs file in the Utilities folder and set "connectionString" to the location of your database.
